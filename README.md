# SmartApps for SmartThings

A small collection of basic SmartApp scripts to automate your home.

## Porch Light

Turn on a switch when someone arrives home and it's after sunset. Written for my porch light, I never have to think about whether I'll arrive home after dark. This is great for those who don't have the ability to install a motion sensor outside their door.

## Smart Fan

Turn on a switch when it's colder outside and the inside temperature is above a set threshold. This is great for climates where it's warm during the day, but cools off quickly in the evening.
